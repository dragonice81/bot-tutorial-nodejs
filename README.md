## Next, create a GroupMe Bot:

Go to:
https://dev.groupme.com/session/new

Use your GroupMe credentials to log into the developer site.

Once you have successfully logged in, go to https://dev.groupme.com/bots/new

Fill out the form to create your new bot:

## Find your Bot ID:<a name="get-bot-id"></a>

Go here to view all of your bots:
https://dev.groupme.com/bots

Click on the one you just created.

On your Bot's page, copy the Bot ID

## Add your Bot ID to your Heroku app:

Go here to see all of your Heroku apps and select the one you just created before:

https://dashboard-next.heroku.com/apps

On your app page, click settings in the top navigation:

On your app's setting page, find the Config Vars section and click the Reveal Config Vars button:

Then click edit:

Fill out the form to add an environment variable to your app:

  * In the "key" field type: BOT_ID
  * In the "value" field paste your Bot ID that you copied in the previous steps
  * Click the save button

## Now go test your bot!

Go to GroupMe and type "/cool guy" in the group where your bot lives to see it in action.

# Make it your own<a name="pull"></a>

## Pull the code to your local machine

Within terminal, change directory to the location where you would like the files to live, then run this command:

    $ heroku git:clone -a YOUR_APP_NAME_HERE

And then change directory into the new folder

    $ cd YOUR_APP_NAME_HERE

## Configure your local BOT_ID environment variable

Open the file `.env` from your local files in your text editor of choice.
Find where it says "YOUR_BOT_ID_HERE" and replace it with the ID of your new bot.

If you don't know what your Bot ID is, please refer back to [this](#get-bot-id) section,
where it is explained how to retrieve it.

If your Bot ID is 12345678910, then:

    BOT_ID="YOUR_BOT_ID_HERE"

becomes:

    BOT_ID="12345678910"

## All done! Go play around and make the bot your own.
