Before Spring break we stayed at her place one night, and I noticed two glass Tupperware containers were sitting out by the sink with food still in them and the lids still on. I thought \"those look likes Sophies. I wonder if her roommates have the same kind.\" Today we went over there and those containers were STILL there. And Sophie said \"those are mine. Will you help me clean them?\" I did, and it was fucking disgusting. In one container was chicken and beans. Rotting because someone had left it sitting on the counter for at least two weeks. The other container had what looked like fucking liver. It smelled so bad. I'm pissed at how rude someone is. That's 10 times worse than anything Gabby ever left",

If you have to spray bullets at animal to kill it, you probably suck at hunting and what will there be left of it to heat? And 2. One shot from a bullet will take trespassers down.\nIf just want a little hand gun kept locked in a safe. So if someone breaks in, I can easily access it",

She then came back in 2016 after her boyfriend fled Indiana and moved to Miami where he is currently a cocaine and other drugs. She did some hard stuff heroin, LSD etc. and now she just smokes blunts everyday about and only gets involved with LSD two to three times a year.

    "I think disorder sounds way different from illness ",

    "Soul food?",

    "My parents wouldn't be happy it if we didn't stop, and @Kali Vanderpool I figured you'd be in my car and we are for sure dropping! ",
    "It just drains your spirit",
    "You don't physically die",
    "I don't wanna die, so stopping seems preferable",
    "True ",
    "Add I'm still debating stopping",
    "Realistically it'd be shared between like 3 of us like last year",
    "Okay good!",
    "At least in my car we would ",
    "Stop for sure ",
    "Even  without shots I bet you at least brown ",
    "Would we drive all the way through or stop?",
    "Maybe if you didn't drink anything else, and ate, but if you take shots too I'm\nBetting you black out",
    "Darby said her mom wants her too, and Joe I'm assuming would drive but he may fly with her... I guess that's another detail to figure out",
    "If I start drinking at 8 am and pace myself I may be able to do it",
    "Why is Darby flying? Is Joe flying, too?",
    "Haha that'd be awesome",
    "A day",
    "Times",
    "Or blacks out several ",
    "And Garrett may by a 100oz cup to put 20-25 margs in so he you know dies during break ",
    "Ok cools",
    "And congrats @Gur-it ",
    "SPI 2k17 is in action",

    "And I don't have jury duty",
    "TL;DR - We have 8 ppl to SPI",
    "I feel so lost",
    "Ye",
    "That's insane ",
    "I will at the next truck stop",
    "I did the math, you could put 20-25 cosmos or margs in them",
    "Wait what?? Send pic ",
    "They sell 100 oz big gulps at these truck stops. I'm debating getting one for SB",
    "Thanks 👍🏻",

    "Confirm #2",
    "Safe flight ",
    "Okay that's good",
    "Okay taking off now. Talk to you later ",
    "5 1/2 hours from Austin so that's probably the best airport to look at ",
    "Or as soon as you figure it out tell me",
    "Okay and let me know as soon as possible so she can get set too",
    "Yeah I'll look stuff up in Chicago",
    "So Darby we need to figure out your flight and match amanda so you two can get picked up at the same time ",
    "I think one of the big airports I looked up is only 6 hours from SPI",
    "Not if we break their kneecaps and tell them not to sue",
    "I'd say you're missing out on the road trip but Houston is half way and Austin is like another 9 hours haha",
    "No completely understandable! Don't even worry about it! ",

    "That's understandable @Darby Mackintosh ",
    "Even though I trust you guys, probs not to driving my car ",
    "Or Alexa and I drive 2 cars?",
    "So we drive your car?",
    "Fly to Austin and then get picked up and drive the rest @Darby Mackintosh ",
    "Then y'all could pick us up 😏",
    "My mom wants me to fly to south padre soooo if Amanda wants to fly into Austin or wherever i could meet her at the airport ",
    "Or yeah, fly to indy",
    "She could probably fly from Jersey to Austin, little rock, Houston, or Memphis",
    "I had either a. Fly to Indy and drive with us or b. Fly somewhere in Texas and be picked up On the way ",
    "Idea Forum is open ",
    "Hahaha ",
    "Oxen?",
    "@Gur-it We gotta figure that out",

    "It conserves body heat",
    "Yea, she had 7 of what we had last time",
    "So then looks like all three boys get the bed and I'm on the cot ",
    "Actually? ",
    "@Gur-it So you can cuddle?",
    "They didn't have the pullout one ",
    "Cause if so, that's fine ",
    "Dylan and I call bed",
    "It's the pull out couches, right? ",
    "Yes that's what I'm thinking would be best, is that cool @Darby Mackintosh ?",
    "That sounds horrible ",
    "Dear god",
    "So rooms are going to be Alexa, Amanda, Kali and Taylor and then I'm bunking with the boys?",
    "Sorry I was busy going through hell at the airport. Lost my wallet so had zero identification. I had to wait for them to look me up which took 30 min and then had to go through security, get a pat down and get all my bags unpacked and checked and for some reason my backpack set something off so thy had to take everything out of my backpack and even uncapped my pens and it all took over an hour 🙄",
    "😂😂😂😂",
    "Sorry I was texting and talking on the phone at the same time",
    "Thank you for the translation. I was pretty shit at foreign language",

    "Alexa did you get the rooms?",
    "Ye",
    "No that was Alex we met",
    "Nice",
    "She's the kinky one wanted a guy to shove a plunger up her ass",

    "Huh that's interesting ",
    "Her classes are all foreign language shit. I think it might be like foreign studies or something. Idk",
    "I think it's Spanish hahaha ",
    "Major*?",
    "What's her Majorca",
    "Lucky duck",
    "I saw that too 🤓 ",
    "Okey dokey cause I saw that Jordan had already gotten her grades back. She got a perfect 4.0 of course",
    "I think usually by Tuesday at midnight or wake up Wednesday and they are available",
    "When do grades come out?",
    "Blackhawk",
    "Perfect ",
    "Haha I'll text Taylor again either tonight or tomorrow morning about it",
    "I say that's good news cause while we are waiting for Taylor we don't have to worry about reservations being booked up!",
    "Good news.. well bad for the people of SPI but good for us... they had an island wide power outage and cannot take any reservations right now and couldn't take anymore last night... so I put my name and number and they said they'd call back when they are back up and running",
    "Tomorrow I'll call, and mid afternoon and keep updating how many rooms\nOf the sort we want are available and if the number dwindles too much we can book.\n\nI know the booking office closes at 9 and reopens at 9 so that's good and they weren't taking any more reservations until after 7:30 ",
    "Yea I'll keep checking on how many rooms are available \n",
    "That's fine",
    "She's not going home until tomorrow afternoon so it won't be until later tomorrow",
    "This will be slot better than packing 6 of us in a room haha",
    "We should be fine calling them back tomorrow then once Taylor confirms",
    "Yes one of my calls tonight",
    "Tonight?",
    "One of my calls they had 11-13 about ",
    "How many rooms did he say were left?",
    "Thats fine!",
    "Ugh",
    "He answered he said call back in\n30 ",
    "Hahaha",
    "A while ",
    "How long have you been on hold?",
    "?*",
    "Im still\nOn hold, should I hold off until tomorrow. ",
    "So tomorrow when she asks we may need to snag room #2",
    "L I guess",
    "Im assuming its wrist to fingertip",
    "I mean I guess it's better to have bigger then needed gloves than gloves that are too tight",
    "What is this measuring? wrist to fingertip?",
    "Large? ",
    "Medium?",
    "What size gloves do you think Joe would wear?",
    "I mean beer is booze",
    "Fuck dat",
    "i guess it can mean beer too",
    "yah haha",
    "I think its bring your own booze",
    "Or booze",
    "I thought it was bottle...",
    "Yeah haha",
    "Trista and Cass are telling me it does...",
    "Does byob really stand for bring your own beer?",
    "I'll bring Tavni's blow up mattress",
    "Get a cabana",
    "Cabana*",
    "So everyone just like this again if I showed continue on my\nPhone call and get the cab a a",
    "I called the tower is completely booked for spring break special and normal rate ",
    "Those bastards",
    "@Gur-it  Idk....it had it on mine. Maybe someone just booked over the phone?",
    "Get a cabana",
    "You can't book at the special rates on the website",
    "He said again the tower is sold out ",
    "I'm on the phone now",
    "Not a clue @Kali Vanderpool ",
    "When I call I'll ask again, but when I talked to him it was a no go",
    "Why would it be call only? ",
    "@Gur-it ",
    "there is one left!",
    "There is a special spring break one but to book it's call only",
    "Yes. And when I manually enter in the dates in the website to book like a normal person",
    "Yes",
    "or the actual website/",
    "on the SB page?",
    "And I'm not seeing any tower rooms when I search",
    "Ohhh theres a special spring break website?",
    "When I called he said there were none available at all!",
    "How much is the tower again? $580?",
    "Are you checking the spring break thing?",
    "Probably not at the spring break rate",
    "wait on the webiste it says theres a tower",
    "If that happens, my ass is goin to California ",
    "Watch all rooms be booked",
    "I am going to call now and get it booked my dad and I were talking and I couldn't find an exit to the conversation to say I'm gonna make a call right quick hahaha",
    "Unless he's buying massaged Japanese wagyu steaks and caviar it can't be that much",
    "He really is ",
    "He's a piece of shit.",
    "Lol in high school I went out to lunch every day and still had enough to go to Austin and go skiing and shit",
    "In high school, I spent a lot of my money on food, but I still had enough to go to Europe for 3 weeks sooo, I call bs.\nI told him we're being pushy because rooms are goin fast",
    "Haha I dont know! How'd you respond to Shawn?",
    "If he does, he's an idiot. Food is good, but spending it all?",
    "😂😂😂😂😂",
    "He probably wants his glorified Toyota Camry",
    "He told me he spends all his money on food. I called bull shit",
    "As for Shawn, I don't know. He probably has a fuck ton of money saved up. His school is covered and he has a damn job",
    "Haha true",
    "Maybe it all depends on if they get the Christmas money or not. That's what I bank on 😁",
    "The thing I dont understand is how they wont know their finances...what do they think is going to change? Either you can save up for the trip or you cant.",
    "Why do people book shit so far ahead? If everyone chilled, we could chill about this",
    "Very true! Alright I'm getting us set now. If it is us 6 it'll be tight but I think we can make it work! ",
    "Yeah cause we can make it work with 6, and if they decide now, it'll work with them too. But if not, that's a them problem",
    "Yes but that's their problem",
    "I'm getting our room\nNow",
    "But they need to decide before all the rooms are gone... that's the problem, those guys think they have so much time, they do not have any time!!! Haha ",
    "If we have 10 people it would be $450 per person with the wrist bands",
    "Ye. We can play it by ear until then since we may end up getting another person or 2",
    "Well if its after break, our paying things might change",
    "Biggs**",
    "I'm not worried about it though, so forget it for now. I'll call and get it taken care of we can talk money later! No Boggs ",
    "If we do 1 room, it's $420/person",
    "Ye, you'll be paid back but we can wait and see how it plays out with the rooms",
    "Yes after break, but I just want to have a plan so that we all know who owes what",
    "If we do the wristband thing with 6",
    "Arent we paying you pack after break?",
    "We worked out the cost to be like 420",
    "480",
    "how much is one room for four people?",
    "So back to\nMy question how do we divide the cost for now? ",
    "Yes",
    "Because we all want to go for sure",
    "I still vote we proceed with 1 room now",
    "Oh okay!",
    "I think only louis and moises were going to go",
    "There's 6 going, and they have 5 in their house, don't they?",
    "We need them to confirm though so we can get two rooms ",
    "how?",
    "It's be 5 and 6",
    "Unless we do 5 per room haha",
    "As in, two more",
    "Their*",
    "But now, if there roommates come, that's another room wed have to get",
    "Okay sounds good, I'll get us a room. My parents will need to be paid back so what're we doing for that. Dividing the price by 6 for now and dealing with the wristband cost split when we get there? ",
    "Okay then yeah, get a room",
    "Tower is full",
    "So no tower?",
    "So get a room now, keep asking around until they fill up and if we find someone get room 2. Else stick with the wristband idea",
    "I didn't want to make that decision and commit us and you guys be unhappy\n",
    "@Darby Mackintosh exactly",
    "That's my thought that's why I haven't done it @Kali Vanderpool i wanted to talk to you guys first ",
    "But if they fill up before then then we do wristband",
    "well we're going no matter what, right?",
    "Keep asking around and if we get another person then get another room",
    "If we do that though, then we're committing to the wristband idea ",
    "I didn't, he said they were swamped with checkouts but they do have rooms\nAvailable and for our dates ",
    "We should at least book one now",
    "I texted Shawn. He probably is gonna be am ass hat and not answer",
    "Did you ask how many of the other rooms were left",
    "Shawn and Chris annoy me",
    "No I didn't ",
    "The worker seemed to be confident, he was giving me inside info without being too obvious that he was telling\nMe how to get us to chest the system. So his biggest point was the bands need to be on at all times and current. He didn't seem to have worries or give any precautions about them running out of wristbands ",
    "Have you booked a room?",
    "But if only 2 roomies wanna go, then we don't need to even worry about wristbands",
    "Would they be guaranteed a wristband everyday though? Cause that's risky business if not",
    "😊",
    "Haha no worries",
    "Sorry I tried to explain best to could 😔",
    "Me too. I just woke up haha",
    "The day ones get them on the beach the night ones get them to the pool and sleeping in the room",
    "AHHH all the numbers were confusing me",
    "We need day ones the whole time except for arrival day! That's it that's the only day we only need a night one",
    "But like every day?",
    "We won't get there until evening? Idk...",
    "Wait slightly confused on the wristband thing...so why wouldnt they need day ones?",
    "5 per room wouldnt be the worst thing",
    "Yea those guys need to come!",
    "I will tell Shawn",
    "Dang ",
    "Someone tell shawn and chris to just invite their roommates to south padre",
    "Nope nothing...",
    "@Darby Mackintosh heard anything from Taylor?",
    "We need to find at least one more friend because 7 people\nWorks to cut the cost ",
    "I know so we need to decide what we want to do here",
    "That's very true",
    "I don't know though. The rooms were already small for 4 people",
    "So $430 a person",
    "Total price for this looks like $1920(hotel) + 5*120(day/night bands)+60(Saturday night band) = $2580",
    "Sunday through Friday both morning and night\nSaturday just night \n",
    "And yes Garrett Friday my mistake!",
    "Does this all make sense?",
    " But In order to get away with everyone sleeping over we need the night band everyday even if they don't plan on partying at the pool",
    "This room is also going to be fucking cramped",
    "OK. And what about Friday",
    "They are separate",
    "Yes each one is $30. Morning is $30 and night is $30",
    "And what about Friday?",
    "There's a separate morning and evening band?",
    "I believe so about $480 ",
    "Yes but I'm\nCounting Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday at $120 and Saturday at $60 Total since we won't need a morning band. ",
    "Regular room was ~$480?",
    "So just 120*7",
    "No $60\nPer day $120 for two people ",
    "So 120*7*2?",
    "So the wristband is $120 per person per day?",
    "Solution: we book a room for 4\nPeople and then have two people go on the wristband package ($120 each person) per day ($660) for the week. Take the cost of the one room plus $660 and divide it buy 6. Then two people who need to go down to the front desk each morning and each night and get a new wristband and that would need to be done everyday. ",
    "Is the solution that you've found 2 people to come with us?",
    "Problem: The tower is booked",
    "They're out of rooms",
    "@Darby Mackintosh @Gur-it @Kali Vanderpool ",
    "And a solution",
    "Alright everyone we have a problem",
    "16 minutes 🙄",
    "I've been on hold with isla grand for 11 minutes 🙄",
    "Confirmed that Joes cool with it",
    "Alright sounds good",
    "You can probably book it ",
    "Just texted Joe but I'm sure it will be fine ",
    "Confirm",
    "Also I think I could bring a blowup mattress if Tanvi isn't using it",
    "Okay and then confirm from\n@Kali Vanderpool ",
    "I'm sure Dylan is as he was pushing for it 😂 I'll ask joe right now ",
    "Dylan is",
    "*$580",
    "Dylan and Joe okay with &580",
    "Ye",
    "Okay sounds good!",
    "To their account ",
    "Check to my mom/dad or Venmo me and I can transfer to my bank and my mom has access to my bank account and she can transfer it back ",
    "So we're doing 11-18 and it worked out to be like $580 each I think",
    "What would be the best/easiest way for you? Check to your mom?",
    "That's actually fine I just transfer it to my bank account and my mom can transfer! ",
    "😜 jk",
    "Venmo? ",
    "Ye",
    "If that's cool?",
    "I'll book y'all pay me ",
    "Eh whatever. So how're we booking this? I can write a check right when we get back in January",
    "I'd say that's a safe bet ",
    "Cause I'm assuming it's me and joe; Kali and Alexa and Gur-it and Dylan sharing?",
    "Looks like it's Dylan and Garrett's couch 😜",
    "Same",
    "I second that",
    "Call not the pull out 😜",
    "Hey new experience 👌🏻",

    "If we're giving up on finding more people we should do the tower",
    "Whenever we get confirm on what we should do a condo for 6 or book 2 rooms and hope\nTo get at least 7 ",

    "Ye. There's also the Bahamas and Cancun for less than 500",
    "Oh okay!! Wow",
    "I checked that. The average temperature in October is a little higher than the average in South padre when we were there",
    "Will it be too chilly for the beach? ",
    "So... I was looking at fall break options and one thing that I saw was Myrtle Beach for $250 a person including flight and hotel right on the beach",
    "That is a picture of 6God, but I didn't make it ",
    "Did you make Jay Cutler Jesus? ",
    "So cool! This is uber exciting",
    "Thirteen days sooner than last year ",
    "Wow the paint crew is sold out! ",
    "Ye. Like I said, I've got 12 mg tabs that I've used",
    "Maybs I'll try that",
    "Try taking more than 1 melatonin tablet tonight. Can't hurt ",
    "And I'd say maybe go decaf if all else fails",
    "I did! All day I had a headache, and I finally just popped 3 advil and felt great! But ya know, I like the heroin idea",
    "I've heard heroins real good for getting off of caffeine ",
    "Take all the advils ",
    "I realized I'm strongly addicted to caffeine. I've been getting caffeine headaches",
    "A cup of coffee before 3pm",
    "How much are you drinking?",
    "I'm training myself to wake up at 8:30 every day and I'm cutting out caffeine and sugar (after 7pm)",
    "Are you drinking any caffeine still?",
    "^^^yes that makes sense",
    "1 for 2 isn't bad Kali. And I'd go run at like 9 or something so that by the time 11 or 12 roles around you're pretty tired",
    "I run better at night, but yeah, it keeps me awake. Gets my blood flowin",
    "Although, exercising usually wakes me up",
    "11:27*",
    "Haha I actually might start running at night because it's the perfect weather ",
    "11:28*",
    "Nothing quite like running laps at 11:30",
    "Go try it! Lemme know how it goes ;)",
    "Haha that could work",
    "Just run laps around your house until you're exhausted",
    "I would say benedryl but I know that doesn't work for you",
    "I think that's what Alexa gave me in London so I'd sleep on the bus and it didn't work",
    "And Darbs, melatonin doesn't work very well. Try nyquil z",
    "I read through it haha I always miss out on the conversations though",
    "I mean you didn't miss anything too important since we'll be going over all this in July ",
    "I'm not reading all this stuff...someone can fill me in later haha",
    "I did fall asleep! ",
    "Same. I just kind of assumed it was by Vallarta",
    "I honestly didn't even know where it was in Mexico ",
    "Yeah, and I didn't realize how far away it is. It's on the southern edge of Mexico ",
    "And that average is probably like 1300 now",
    "Yeah no thanks ",
    "Yeah. All inclusive and flight was like 1600",
    "Too expensive?",
    "Acapulco is a no",
    "2010 maybe",
    "And shit I forgot to look at Acapulco ",
    "When did this article come out? I bet that number's gone up",
    "Average student pays $1100 during spring break ",
    "You could try upping that. I've got 12mg ",
    "3mg I think ",
    "What's the dosage on the melatonin your taking? They make them in different doses",
    "Nope. I've just sucked it up and started drinking coffee every morning haha",
    "Have you taken any other sleeping pills?",
    "Ye. I've been taking it because the house is so dusty my allergies really pick up at night",
    "Wait yeah I had some weird dreams too! And no haven't tried anything else",
    "Have you tried to get some actual sleeping pills?",
    "Melatonin isn't that great. It just gives me weird ass dreams and everytime I've gotten sleep paralysis I've taken it",
    "Terrible...I've had it since I've been home. My doctor told me to talk melatonin or whatever but it doesn't work and just gives me a headache ",
    "So how's the insomnia",
    "Yeah I don't really either ",
    "Gotcha. I'm cool with all of them. I don;t know who Marvin is though",
    "Correct",
    "So you're just not actively disliking her",
    "Dylan was saying how Allie was weird ",
    "Haha I don't have a beef with Allie, I just don't go out of my way to be friends with her/talk to her ",
    "I thought you had a beef with Allie or something",
    "Only problem is that's more than 12",
    "Anyone have a problem with any of these people?",
    "The people they were talking about were Louis, Moises, Marvin and Allie",
    "👍🏻",
    "At the discounted rates ye",
    "So we have a max of 12",
    "Gotchu",
    "Ye. It maxes out at 4 per room and I can only get 3 rooms",
    "Including Chris and Emma?",
    "Ye. I can get everyone that went last year",
    "Are you good with all of us?",
    "I don't mind, but I'm not sure how many people I can get in on the discounts",
    "Also, Chris and Shawn asked if it'd be okay if some of their other friends could come",
    "I do too...",
    "I vote no Padre though",
    "Nah I'm still here",
    "Did y'all fall asleep? Because I'm currently going through a long period of insomnia ",
    "So options to throw out to everyone else (in July)\n1. South Padre \n2. Cancun\n3 Dominican ",
    "Ye probs",
    "Yes on the minimum",
    "So we're saying we each at least paid $80 for booze?",
    "Yes so tell him to check his bank statements! ",
    "Tru",
    "But regardless, he's at $200 from food alone",
    "We had the runs to Walmart for chasers too",
    "Yeah so do I. The timeline isn't super accurate",
    "$80? I feel like we spent a bit more than that ",
    "4 booze runs",
    "I'd say like 4 times",
    "I'm getting tired my brain is starting to slow haha ",
    "True duh ",
    "Well we got the deposit back",
    "You guys probably have it too. Google maps makes a timeline",
    "He bought the beer pong table, and we had $75 for the deposit $20 for the wrist band.. Just no way did he only spend $200!",
    "That's high tech",
    "Lemme check GMaps",
    "How many runs?",
    "And he tossed in at least a 20 every time I went",
    "But $200 food then alcohol",
    "So we may be a bit lower in food",
    "Oh ye",
    "Garrett you bought alcohol at dinner though ",
    "224 on food alone",
    "~$14 + $18 * 7",
    "Was at least $20",
    "which is like $20 a day",
    "Lunch/Brunch + Dinner evry day",
    "No way!",
    "My ass",
    "Oh okay.. Not as bad as I thought, but still.. That's a bummer gaha ",
    "Shawn says he only spent $200 on food and booze",
    "Like $60 I think",
    "^^ what!? How much was that? ",
    "Oh yeah, I drunkenly bought a one night pass to the edm thing",
    "Oh I charged the gas too. So I'd be at $550",
    "Ye. And gas",
    "I had $300 in cash and I walked away with our $75 security deposit plus I believe I charged $100 so $400 but I charged the hotels too and got paid back so I'd be at about $450 for food and alcohol ",
    "So that's food and all the alcohol?",
    "It's not because I didn't deposit that money, it's also not counting the deposit",
    "I mean I personally dont know how much money I spent during th break",
    "^yea?",
    "What did you spend $630 on?",
    "Wait is that including all the money we gave you for booze",
    "Yeah...",
    "HOLY SHIT.",
    "Add on the 430 for Isla and there ou go",
    "I spent $630 during Spring break",
    "They're children",
    "Jeeze ",
    "I can't",
    "Punta Cana was cheaper or more expensive depending on what we went with",
    "Yeah, Cancun all-inclusive was like 975 with non-stop flights",
    " Yes it is especially for alcohol too",
    "and what was the price? you said under $1000",
    "Ye",
    "All inclusive is totally worth it",
    "They're quite good, but very expensive",
    "But we're gonna be screwed on food prices. All the restaurants in that area are expensive as flaka",
    "Royal Caribbean",
    "What was the hotel that you were looking at in cancun that was $750?",
    "For shits I'll look at my bank statements from SB2k16",
    "Maybe Shawn will\nChange his tune In a few weeks",
    "Theres no way we could get food and drink for under $700 for a week",
    "Idk man, it's our last spring break. I want to explore",
    "Yes ",
    "so without food and drinks we're at $547",
    "I mean, yeah. None of the places I'm seeing are better than Isla Grand",
    "And south padre was 432 a person\n",
    "The Hampton inns were $24 a\nPerson ",
    "Whats that hotel?",
    "Well gas for my car was like max $50 per tank and we needed just shy of 8 tanks there and back. If we had two more people in my car, we'd split the gas up 6 ways so like $67 on gas per person",
    "I just looked at Cancun real quick, the cheapest hotel in the Hotel Zone (which is where we'd want to stay because it's safe) is like 750 with flight",
    "And alcohol ",
    "We need to add in gas, hotels on the way down and food too",
    "yeahh....",
    "Ye. Assuming we drive?",
    "so 9? / 10 including emma",
    "Okay for shits and giggles, can you look up what the price would be in South padre for all of us?",
    "Dang  ",
    "Everyplace in FL I looked and Gulf Shores banned it too",
    " Okay 😑",
    "Ye",
    "Even for 21+?",
    "Ye",
    "Because everywhere else banned public drinking",
    "The only option in the states is Padre, right?/",
    "Okay thats what I thought",
    "In the states",
    "Padre",
    "Yes.. We spent a good amount.. He didn't realize how much the trip cost in total.. Probs because the costs were spread out",
    "Okay realistically, what could we do for under $700?",
    "We really spent a shit ton when we were down there. I think I went on like 5 booze runs that were $100+",
    "Agreed! I try to tell him that he spent at least $700 on hotel+gas+alcohol",
    "The Dominican Republic is sketchy af",
    "We don't HAVE to do an all-inclusive depending on where we go. Cancun I'd be comfortable without doing one, but in Punta Cana it'd be required",
    "I'm Laughing so hard ",
    "Hahaha ^ I think I just peed",
    "ANd youd probably be flying in on a paper airplane",
    "But that $600\nDoesn't include food or alcohol.. By the time we add that in we are up to 1,000\nIsh' ",
    "For shits I looked at flying to Padre, but it's a small airport so it was like $700",
    "Ye",
    "So you don't hate Paris, you just hated being in Paris",
    "The only way $600 is doable is if we drive back to Texas",
    "I agree ^^ ",
    "And I don't think 600 is doable if we want an all-inclusive",
    "Ohkay well I didnt hate paris, I just didnt like that I had the worst allergic reaction to medicine while I was there in June and couldnt be in the sun",
    "I only like my street crepes in France ",
    "What about Vienna for 800",
    "^^Ugh no I hated Paris",
    "So Paris it is",
    "Well Shawn may be swimming to cancun then",
    "Shawn said $600 would be ideal",
    "Id say so!",
    "Looks like I was pretty damn close",
    "Ohhhh okay",
    "Hes talking about rent minus utilities",
    "The fee set per month? Or something else",
    "What is set-rent? ",
    "Cannot be more than that! It's shit hole city ",
    "COOL.",
    "I'm betting $500",
    "Oh. My. Gosh. 😂😑",
    "Hes saying how he has to pay more for rent because of the prime location of Rahims house",
    "I was just wondering because Shawns trying to exaggerate everything",
    "Idk, I can ask",
    "Random but how much were rahim and them paying for rent a month?",
    "Game 👍🏻",
    "Gotcha. I think I'll go the group with the info in like July so it gives people some more time",
    "I asked but they havent really answered",
    "But, did shawn and chris give a price they'd pay @Darby Mackintosh ?",
    "I like your style*",
    "We can stop by on the way to the cruise in October",
    "I don't play with sea world anymore.. But universal is a ball! ",
    "^^not too shabby",
    "I don't see anything for the theme park though. I do get 40% off Universal and Sea World",
    "I mean I saw a hotel in the disney area for like 560",
    "Yes ",
    "Disney's Orlando right?",
    "Look at you and your bad self ... This is Garrett = 😎",
    "Cognizant's like a $13 billion company",
    "I work for TriZetto, but they're owned by Cognizent",
    "Hahaa @Darby Mackintosh ME.. Hey @Gur-it any deals for Disney? 😂",
    "Wow! What company do you work for cause that shits cray! ",
    "Did they say what the max they'd want to pay is?",
    "Okay who wants to join me and become sister wives to Garrett?",
    "Including flights",
    "Dude this discount is ridiculous. For shits I looked up Paris and I got $650 per person for a week in Paris",
    "RIP",
    "Ohh poo 😔",
    "Both Shawn and Chris are saying that'd be wayyyyy to expensive for them",
    "What a great deal! ",
    "includes errything",
    "Ye",
    "Also, are the prices you threw out all inclusive? So hotel, flight, food and drinks?",
    "AHHH that's okay! Family bonding and all haha ",
    "Haha he said hes going to try to get his sister to buy him a ticket to Amsterdam",
    "Is that his nice way of saying he may get a Better offer? 😔 ",
    "That correction made that sentence harder to read haha",
    "That his*** not this ",
    "Is this a nice way of saying he may get a better offer? 😔",
    "Shawn said this is way to far in advance for him",
    "Okay haha",
    "It was a dumb joke. He's interested",
    "sickness? ",
    "He's down with the sickness",
    "What's his feelings?",
    "I have with Matt",
    "Yes that would probably be best haha ",
    "@Gur-it Have you mentioned to any of the guys?",
    "So... to the SB2k17 chat?",
    "Haha ",
    "Boom One room ",
    "So definitely the four of us...",
    "^^yeah because that will determine the number of rooms we'd need",
    "We need to sure up our head count before we do anything",
    "And they had me at open bar",
    "Lol, @Kali Vanderpool  I have no money. I've had to eat out every night for the past month",
    "Ohh wow ",
    "If we do cancun, there is this extra package which gives you access to all the concerts and parties",
    "I have 400 dollars saved up haha",
    "I don't have the money right now ",
    "Yeah I think we should book it as soon as possibl",
    "Ye. I'm just throwing all this shit out there now because I'm not sure if I'll still have the deals when school starts back up",
    "Yeah whatever you guys wanna do :)",
    "Sames***",
    "Sales",
    "Okay so I'm good with whatever you guys want to do!",

    "@Gur-it 😍🤗☺️",
    "@Gur-it is the real MVP",
    "But none are as cheap as the Riu place",
    "And shifting gears back to SB2017, I just found out I can bundle flights and hotels, so some of the nicer places in Cancun, punta Cana, and Puerto Valletta get pretty affordable ",
    "It was revitalized in 2005",
    "I'm checking into if it has been refurbished recently ",
    "It's an older ship 1996 ",
    "Sounds beautiful",
    "Enchantment of the seas",
    "Oh wow that's a very small increase for a quality cruise line! Does it say which ship?",
    "That's 282/person ",
    "Love Royal",
    "What about royal Caribbean ",
    "A good source of entertainment",

    "Not bad",
    "Carnival ",

    "They don't have any non all-inclusive rooms/packages ",
    "Confirmed that price is the all inclusive ",
    "Sweet deal",
    "Haha okay sounds good!",
    "I'm fairly certain. I'll double check when I get to my computer since doing this on mobile is painful ",
    "Well I mean is that in the price?",
    "Well it had \"all-inclusive\" in the name so I'm assuming ye",
    "Is it all inclusive as well?",
    "Yeah it really is. It's cheaper than isla grand was",
    "Dangg...thats good!",
    "Ye. Check in 11th, check out 19th",
    "408$ for the week ?",
    "Ohh that means it'll be wild haha ",
    "That's where student city goes apparently ",
    "And Riu Naiboa for 408",
    "Ye",
    "This is still in Punta Cana, right?",
    "Riu is $560",
    "There's also Barcelo Bavaro Palace Deluxe for 655/person ",
    "very good point! ",
    "So the cheapest flights I see right now is united for 390-480 depending on when we go. But frontier and Southwest don't let you book that far in advance and they will definitely be cheaper than united",
    " I'm asking Devon and my friend what resorts their friends have gone to",
    "Okay!",
    "That's one of the places ",
    "Check out Riu Bambu",
    "It's always ab day",

    "Now the tag works ",
    "Garrett Lewis changed name to Gur-it",
    "Hahaha ^ @Darby Mackintosh ",
    "Hotel",
    "Okay @gur-it you're in charge of spring break ☺️ I also nominate Alexa, if she wants ",
    "Okay gotcha.. What is the note\nCalled?",
    "Now, I'm not sure if the all inclusive I found is the place where all the spring break shenanigans happen so I'll have to look into it",
    "that's beautiful  ",
    "There may be due taxes on the fight",
    "OHHH WOW ",
    "OHHH ",
    "850 is everything",
    "Because you said $850 per person in addition to the fight",
    "Does the $850 include taxes? ",
    "Why did you say no before?",
    "Okay that's what I said ",
    "No. 850 is per person",
    "No 850 per person ",
    "So 850/4 that seems to good to be true ",
    "^^^thats perfect! ",
    "No. 850 is room+ flight",
    "So 850\nPer person for the room and the $380 flight?",
    "Wed definitely want an all inclusive in the Dominican republic haha",
    "Ye",
    "?*",
    "Okay and is that all inclusive drinks food. ",
    "All told I think it was like $850 total for the week with 4 to a room ",
    "I think I saw round trip flights for like $380",
    "Thank you haha ",
    "Ye",
    "Wait Dominic republic and Punta Cana are the same place.. Right? 🙃",
    "Punta Cana that's where Amanda is going ",
    "I was actually going to say, punta Cana was the cheapest option I saw for an all inclusive ",
    "Guys my friend said that everyone from her school goes to the Dominican Republic their senior year for spring break...that could be a good place to look at",
    "^^same! If someone plans it, I'm game for anything ",
    "Sounds good to me! :)",
    "Oh gotcha",
    "Didn't look too hard. There wasn't much to choose from",
    "What hotel there?",
    "Nassau flights are cheaper, like just over $400",
    "Oh nice!",
    "I looked at Cancun and Nassau",
    "Mexico?",
    "Destinations?",
    "So what designations? ",
    "I'm down ",
    "Sweet",
    "Ye. And nonstop if we go out of Chicago ",
    "That's a major plus ^^",
    "Which isn't bad at all. Plus we're flying instead of driving ",
    "That's awesome ",
    "Ye same. And these numbers are for a full week down there",
    "I mean I'm fine with that price, it would just be everyone else",
    "If we want an all inclusive no, but it's not much higher than $1000",
    "So could we get the overall price to be under $1000?",
    "For flights ye, but for the most part it looks like the special spring break rates for hotels are a little better",
    "Ohh would it make a big difference?",
    "Since you guys are with me you'd get the rates too",
    "Well I was thinking more of using it for spring break haha",
    "Ooo where are you going to go?",
    "Including international ones",
    "So I just found out that I get corporate rates for flights and hotels",
    "I will!",
    "Well tell her good luck for me! ",
    "AON ",
    "I know, Darbs, I was just kidding 😉",
    "Where is she working?",
    "I know!! ",
    "No I meant Devon",
    "Hahaha 😂😂",
    "Yes my dog starts work next week",
    "Your dog?",
    "Awee ^^",
    "Meanwhile my only friend /source of entertainment starts work next week 😭",
    "It's never done",
    "It's not done yet??!! Dang!",
    "Haha ye. It also doesn't help that I still don't have a fully working house yet",
    "I just hang out with my sisters and my friend from work haha",
    "Ye. None of my friends came home for the summer so working out and work is all I've got",
    "Awe Garrett you go getting those abs ",
    "Money bags is just making it rain @Garrett Lewis ",
    "Fair enough. I need to start working out, but I don't have time and when I do, I'd rather have fun haha",
    "Ye. But I at least want to make an attempt at abs",
    "Lame",
    "Can't remember. They may be with some of the shit at my apartment ",
    "Garrett, do you still have the redds caps I told you to save or did you throw them away?",
    "Yeah, I've been drinking redds a lot. Haha but I have about 30 from Germany and some are really cool!",
    "Get on it @Garrett Lewis ",
    "I need to catch up. I don't have any haha",
    "Good idea @Darby Mackintosh ",
    "We can take a run through and find some cool tops",
    "Go for something unique! We have a ton of reds already ",
    "A 12 pack of redds each? We can chug, and prep\nFor beer Olympus round two 😂",
    "Yeah, she has quite a bit! Alexa, tomorrow we should get something in bottles to drink",
    "Darby has some too! ",
    "Go kali! Makin moves ",
    "200 for the entire thing? More like 2000...I have over 100",
    "3 down, like 200 to go",

    "Hahaha I love that you two had to share a room\nKali! That's hysterical ",
    "Don't have to be the fastest, just have to be faster than the slowest ",
    "Hey man as long as Darby and Alexa can distract the ghost long enough for us to run away then we're fine ",
    "😂😂",
    "Lord haha.. Hey I believe Darby and I could take on a ghost no problem 💪🏼",
    "I had a dream last night that Garrett, you were my step brother and we were pissed cause we had to share a room. But our house was haunted and one night we thought something was trying to break in so we called Darby and Alexa to come over haha like they could protect us 😂",
    "She's Picasso obviously ",
    "She cray cray",
    "Haha no idea what this girl was thinking 😂",

    "Guys there's also these websites \n\nhomeaway.com\n\nAnd \n\nAirbnb.com \n\nThey have pretty good deals",
    "When you go and pick dated the prices goes up so for two double beds... So weekends are $106 per night and weekdays are around $30\nPer night",
    "Ye. If we're cool with taking Spirit to FL I don't see why we wouldn't consider this place haha",
    "I mean $22 a night is a steal ",
    "I don't know! Haha but I don't think we should really stay there 😂",
    "So when are we going ",
    "No wonder why it's $22 a night 😂",
    "Ew the hell? ",
    "Oh  they are dressed like hooters ",
    "Yes. That's true... And I can't imagine they could have their whole staff dressed that way, that'd be ridiculous ",
    "As for the staff dressed like hookers....Ehhh idk how I'd feel about that. Im not into objectifying women",
    "If there aren't, it's an abomination and doesn't deserve the title Hooters Hotel! ",
    "Yes it did! Hooters hotel.. Do you think the whole staff dresses like a hooters restaurant? Do they think there are free wings? ",
    "Haha you're wish came true! I'd be down for Vegas. I love gambling. Play some blackjack! I've been practicing 😏",
    "^thank you",

    "Haha hooters hotel",

    "You got drunk at the cactus last night",
    "Hey friends guess what?",
    "Have a nice vacation! And sounds good ",
    "Hey guys, I'm leaving for vacation today and won't have wifi. I'll turn on my data every now and then to keep my streaks on snapchat going. But if you guys discuss more fall break stuff, or anything else, I won't see it! Just letting you know!",
    "Works for me",
    "Okay, just got to converse with the Grand Rents",
    "Ye I agree ",
    "Yea I think spirit is the way to go",
    "I'd say they're more like the North Korea of airlines. But at that price yolo ",

    "It is spirit airlines. But that is cheap ",

    "Tue I would be into it especially because the beach 🤗",
    " Vegas is also expensive ",
    "Plus it's free minus the flight",
    "Mini spring break in Raton would be dope ",
    "It is 😑",
    "But it's also the most expensive ",
    "Disney we were thinking less rides more bar crawl through Epcot 😂",
    "😍😍😍",

    "Ye I hear you. I'm love to go to Mexico but it is mucho expensivo and I'm not sure how many people would want/be able to swing it",
    "True. But I kinda want to go somewhere else for Spring Break. I mean Its fine if that's all there is",
    "And for what it's worth, the rooms in the tower at isla were much nicer than the ones we were in",
    "Also, that's where the big edm festival was going on all week I think",
    "Which I'd assume we'd actually want to go to since it wouldn't just be me constantly losing and then re-finding rahim",
    "It is farther away from most of the night life",
    "Not sure it's worth the money...how expensive is it?",
    "So vote to try and stay there? ",
    "Much",
    "Better than isla?",
    " Nice rooms!",
    "Did you see what the rooms looked like?",
    "Schlittrrbahn ",
    "Water park wasn't that cool honestly ",
    "Was that a ye to Mississippi or a ye to schlitterbahn (if we decide to go back)",
    "Hahah Mississippi hahaha yes if we go back we should def do that! ",

    "Ye. Banned in gulf shores and every place in FL I could think of",
    "Hmm ",
    "Seriously? ",
    "For the US, it looks like Texas is one of the last places where beach drinking is still allowed ",
    "Pretty much the same thing (give or take like $100) at Cabo, Vallarta, etc",
    "Oh okay, hmm\nLet me ask her",
    "$1600 was what I was seeing ",
    "I just looked through student city and it was $1600. How much did Amanda pay?",
    "What if we find a package deal with flights included ",
    "What are options in the us then?",
    "So one thing that I'm seeing is that the flights themselves are like as much as we paid for our place in S Padre",
    "So Matt's basically in, just depends on the $",
    "Ye",
    "My mom suggested the Bahamas as another idea ",
    "I'll take a look when I leave the corec",
    "Right on. The Bahamas could be worth a look too",
    "No I didn't. I'm driving home from Chicago now with my mom so she's been asking me a lot of questions. Two biggest topics are \"what furniture do I need for my apartment next year\" and \"where are you going for spring break\" soo that's why I brought it up 😂",
    "Did you look at Cabo/Puerto Vallarta too? They might be cheaper ",
    "Ye. Although those prices are basically what I saw when I was looking around in November so we've got plenty of time",
    "Sweet ",
    "Chris is also in I think and Shawn most likely",
    "Okay well ask them where they'd want to go. I think it would be good for us to get it booked earlier this year so we get a better deal 😂 don't have to ask right away though",
    "I think they'd both be in ",
    "Ye like south by Southwest ",
    "Interesting...what about Matt and Dylan?",
    "A convention? ",
    "A convention? ",
    "He wants to go to a convention type thing I think",
    "Haha what kind of thing would he want to do then?",
    "Dunno, I'll ask. I know Rahim was saying he personally didn't want to do a beach thing again",
    "@Kali Vanderpool it's fine, we don't have to book this now",
    "What about Rahim Dylan and Matt?",
    "Probably like 1500 for me",
    "1,000 or so and I just got the thumbs up from the rents to go to either Punta Cana or Cancun! ",
    "Sorry",
    "Haha ok that makes it slightly difficult 😂",
    "Depends how much money I make this summer",
    "How much is everyone willing to pay including flights if necessary ?",
    "I think 5",
    "You can pick. Either from go blue website or student city. Not sure which is cheaper",
    "How many days?",
    "Cancun all inclusive prices",
    "Yes 👍🏻",
    "He said we still have it but some rods might be missing. Be we're gonna get it out at some point this summer and see. Ok?",
